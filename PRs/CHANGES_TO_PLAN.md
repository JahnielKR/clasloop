## 2026-05-21 — Skip PR 111 (React Router migration)

**Status:** ⏭️ skipped — already effectively done.

**Reason:** the README of `PR_111_react_router_migration` assumes a starting
state where `App.jsx` dispatches by a shadow `page` state and ignores
`<Routes>`. That description does not match the live code:

- `src/main.jsx` already wraps `<App />` in `<BrowserRouter>` (web) or
  `<HashRouter>` (Capacitor), with `<Routes>` defining `/join` for
  `GuestJoin` and a catch-all `/*` for `<App />`.
- `src/App.jsx` already imports `useLocation, useNavigate, useMatch`
  from `react-router-dom`. It still keeps a `[page, setPage]` shadow
  state for legacy prop compatibility, but that state is **synchronized
  to the URL** by a `useEffect` (lines 736-741) that calls
  `pathToPage(location.pathname)` and updates `page` whenever the URL
  changes. Effectively the URL is already the source of truth.
- Role guard (lines 749-756) uses `navigate(..., { replace: true })` to
  bounce unauthorized roles, which is what the README asks to add.
- Practice deck deep-linking (line 1411-1412) already uses
  `buildRoute.practice(deck.id)` + `navigate(...)`.
- All onNavigate callbacks at the page-prop boundary already call
  `navigate(...)` internally.

The only remaining "improvement" the PR 111 README proposes is replacing
the `<P key={...} ... />` single-component render with an explicit
`<Routes><Route path="..." element={<P ... />} /></Routes>` block. This
is cosmetic: it does not change observable behavior (deep links, back
button, F5 reload, role guard all work today). It costs ~150 LOC of
churn in a 1510-LOC file and requires full smoke-test of every page —
high risk, low return.

**Decision:** declare PR 111 closed by the existing implementation.
Audit finding H7 ("App.jsx dispatch ignores routes.js") is functionally
resolved. Move on to PR 112 (split God-file `App.jsx`), which is what
H7 was really blocking.

**Author of decision:** Claude Code (cowork) under the user's "haz lo
mejor para el proyecto" directive.

**If a future PR really wants to remove the shadow `page` state:**
that would be a separate cleanup PR, smaller in scope than what PR 111
originally proposed. Not blocking anything currently planned.
